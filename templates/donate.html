<p>
    Keeping CodeHighp running takes time.
    Renting servers takes money.
    And I'm just a poor university student.
    As much as I love working on this project, I love being able to feed myself more.
    Sorry if that came out too harsh.
    The point is, I can't do this without your help.
    If you like this project and want to help me pay the server costs,
    please consider donating. I'd be really grateful.
    Maybe even get you a special badge on your profile,
    if that is what you want :)

    Anyway, the PayPal button is over here.
    Click it if you have spare change, I'd appreciate it.
